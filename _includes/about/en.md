Hi, I am *@ms2008*, a software engineer. Messing with computers for over 10 years.

This site's main purpose is to serve as the home of a slowly updating collection of technotes for my experience, primarily focused on Lua/OpenResty/Python/Golang/TCP_IP.

The articles contained on this site is free, oriented toward experienced users who are interested in high-performance backend programming.

Feel free to email me with any comments, suggestions or bugs. I can't promise to always reply to every email (in fact I tend not to reply to many at all!) due to lack of free time but you can be assured I do read every one I receive.
